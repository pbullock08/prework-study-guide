        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) creates structure for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>It is best practice to use semantic HTML elements in the body of the webpage to make the code easy to read and webpage accessible to all.</li>
          <li>A tag refers to what appears inside the angle brackets, while an elment refers to what appears from opening to closing tag.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language that defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization of the webpage.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a website using CSS but the preferred way is to create an external CSS style sheet in a separate file to allow for separation of concerns based on the use of the code.</li>
          <li>CSS rules have a selector then a declaration block made up of various properties and their defined values (ex. color:blue).</li>
          <li>The CSS box model includes the content and then spacing around the content or element including the padding, the border, and the margin.</li>
          <li>Do not repeat yourself (DRY) code is used to simplify code by combining selectors that follow the same rules.</li>

          <li>Typing git status into the command line checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
